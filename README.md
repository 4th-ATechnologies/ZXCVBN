ZXCVBN
======

This is the ZXCVBN password strength estimation in Objc.

The origin version of ZXCVBN was [a coffee script version](https://github.com/lowe/zxcvbn). But this code was based on [the python version by Ryan Pearl](https://github.com/rpearl/python-zxcvbn/). The JSON generator in tools/ also comes from the python version.

Please refer to [the Dropbox Blog article](http://tech.dropbox.com/?p=165) for the full details and motivation behind zxcbvn.
